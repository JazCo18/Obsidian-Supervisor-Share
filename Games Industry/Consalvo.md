### Atari to Zelda

**Background**
- No longer makes sense to refer to "The Japanese Game Industry" or just "The Game Industry" as such, as if it where a monolithic entity
- Platforms have expanded and the gamer demographic has grown so substantially that games are so varied in nature that they cannot be considered this way
- The industry has changed in recent time also, in that they are no longer trying to target their whole audience in one game, but becoming more specific with who their target audiences are - either through the platform, genre or other
- Changes such as: New markets emerging all over the world, women dominating certain markets and platforms, older players now being a key segment of the market compared to dominated by young, teenage boys dominating the market in the 90's and earlier. Platforms are also part of what determines market demographics - e.g handheld games are more popular in Japan, whilst consoles are more popular in the US, PC's in Europe and online games in South Korea.
- All this points to there being many small diverse industries as opposed to one singular global industry.
- Japan has a unique history with both video games and global perception, as well as globalisation of cultural artefacts in general.
- When arcade games and Nintendo first emerged, Japanese produced games where not easily recognisable to Western audiences
- This is in part due to a conscious decision from publishers to avoid what Koichi Iwabuchi calls "cultural odours". This is the erasure of "Japaneseness" through extensive localisation.
- Interestingly, Japanese influence on the West, and the relationship between Japan and the West goes back far before the "official opening of Japan to the West" in the 1850's, to when Japan was still considered isolated from the rest of the world. Merchants still travelled to Japan to do business and gain inspiration, which led to cultural borrowings on both sides. 
- Despite this long history of trade, and cultural influence, Japan intentionally muted the Japaneseness of many products that they intended to export to the West, but other cultural products like TV and film have had a harder time finding global success because they have far closer cultural connections to Japan.
- When the Us industry crash happened in 1983, Nintendo, cautious of re-entering the American market screened all games to determine what they believed could be released in the West, to ensure that they were not marketing anything that would be considered too foreign or too different.
- As video game popularity grew in the 1990's, Japan began increasing the level of localisation in their games, and some genres like RPG's and Stealth Games (Final Fantasy series and Metal Gear Solid series) found an audience and increased in popularity, others genres did not (board games, panchinko etc).
- Even with the increased popularity of these genres, these games were not released as is, and would undergo a process of increased localisation for the US, UK and German markets. 
- Nowadays, developers from all over the world attend GDC to listen to talks about popular games from around the world, including Japan, to learn about each others forms, techniques and tools - this is a process that goes both ways where Asian developers and Western developers are learning from each other, leading to further hybridity of digital games.
- Despite this increased cross-cultural influence, many games have been criticised for "orientalism" of Japanese influenced games, with Elmer Tucker arguing that "Orientalism persists as the default framework through which gaming depicts Easter cultures", with some Japanese companies internalising this framework and catering to the "Western audiences fetish".
**Questions of this project**
- What happens when Japanese games travel outside of their country of origin and are used, thought about, and transformed by individuals, companies, and groups in the West?
**Methods used**
- Talking with players of Japanese games (player account)
- Played games (autoethnography)
- Interview Western developers about design influences, examining business side of the industry (Industry account)
- Explored Japans influence on Europe (cultural analysis)
- Talked with European fans of Japanese games, and European developers but focus was on how Japanese games influence North America (as the dominant Western market)
