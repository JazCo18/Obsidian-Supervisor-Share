- Is interactivity the most useful concept to understand contemporary digital games? Kerr, Kucklich and Brereton, (2006); Crawford, (2012) argue suggest that even at just a textual level, interactivity does not adequately capture the complexity of the relationship between the developer, player, and the game.
- The gaming industry is shaped by a mix of creative traditions and commercial pressures


**Most Important Chapters (Core Focus for Encoding)**

**1. Chapter 3: Production**

This chapter gives you the essential academic language and context to talk about how both types of studios operate and why they make the choices they do.

• **Why it helps with Corporate Encoding (****AC Shadows****):** It defines the dominant business model for huge games, the **Publishing Logic**, where large publishers fund high-risk projects and try to control the creative process to minimize financial risks. You can use the discussion of the **lack of diversity in the workforce** (mostly young, white men) to explain why a massive transnational company might struggle with "authentic encoding" of Japanese history or a Black protagonist like Yasuke.

• **Why it helps with Authentic Encoding (****South of Midnight****):** It details the nature of **project-based work** and the rise of small, independent companies that exist outside the big corporate machine. This provides context for how a marginalized-led studio works, often seeking "creative independence" by forming their own company.

**2. Chapter 4: Circulation**

This chapter directly addresses the _market reduction of risk_ that drives the "Corporate Encoding" of _AC Shadows_.

• **Why it helps with Corporate Encoding (****AC Shadows****):** The sections on **Design and Metrics** and **Marketing** show that for big online games, design is often "metric-driven". Marketing teams use player data to reduce risk and maximize money. This is exactly the corporate pressure that informs how transnational publishers encode controversial identities—they prioritize market success over creative freedom.

• **Why it helps with Differential Decoding (UK/Japan):** The section on **Localization and Culturalization** is key. It explains that being "global is about being prepared for, and attentive to, the local". This helps you analyze why a Japanese player, possessing the necessary "socio-historical background", might decode the representation differently than a UK player—because the company must balance the global appeal with local cultural sensitivities when adapting content.

**Supporting Chapters (Context and Policy)**

**3. Chapter 5: Going Local (Space, Place, and Policy)**

This chapter provides the surrounding framework for understanding the national and regional forces acting on both case studies.

• **Why it helps with Production Context:** It discusses how governments use **tax incentives and funding** to influence where companies locate and what content they produce (the French/UK tax credits often promote "culturally British/European" games). This explains the political pressure influencing transnational production locations like Ubisoft's studios.

• **Why it helps with Authentic/Corporate Contrast:** It contrasts the formal industry structures with non-market, grassroots groups (like game jams or collectives) that focus on alternative games or diversity, providing a foundation for discussing your marginalized studio's "counter-hegemonic" intent

By focusing on **Chapter 3 (Production)** and **Chapter 4 (Circulation)**, you will gain a firm understanding of the political economy and labor dynamics that shape both corporate and independent encoding practices, which is vital before you analyze how those encodings are interpreted by players in **Chapter 5 (Going Local)**.

Think of it this way: to understand why a large ship (the transnational AAA studio) steers the way it does, you need to know about the engine (Chapter 3: Production Logic) and the navigation system (Chapter 4: Metrics and Marketing). To understand the small, specially designed boat (the marginalized studio), you need to know how it operates outside those massive constraints and how local currents and regulations (Chapter 5) affect both.
