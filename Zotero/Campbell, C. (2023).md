**Page 7**

        
            
- **Highlight:** George Gerbner examines the long-term effects of television on viewers conceptions of social reality
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Cultivation Theory argues that media imagery can change viewers perceptions of the real world in the way reality is depicted in the media messages they consume (Katz, 2001, in Stacks, Li and Spaulding, 2015
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Shrum (2002) expands on this with his cognitive processing version of the theory, in which he explains that the presence or absence of certain depictions of groups causes a set of impressions on viewers through what he calls well studied cognitive mechanisms
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Price and Tewksbury (1997) referred to as a ‘knowledge store’. Price and Tewksbury (1997) describe the ‘knowledge store’ as “a network of constructs including information about social objects and attributes” (1997: 186). They also add that these constructs are accessible when they are reinforced, repeated and relatively recent in the mind.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Williams, Martins, Consalvo, & Ivory, 2009) echoes this in his explanation that media acts as a mirror to expose the imbalances present in current social policy, identity formation, and power.
                
            
        

    
**Page 8**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Cultivation theory observes two main outcomes. These are labelled as first outcomes and secondary outcomes. The first is where media observers believe that the imagery they are viewing is reflective of the real world. A study conducted over four decades exploring the effects of television messages found an increased ‘distorted’ reality in its viewers, as well as increase in gender stereotyping (Morgan et al, 2009). Cultivation analysis from this study concluded that despite individual differences between people, the reality cultivated by television became the dominant or mainstream culture of society, concluding that “television viewing may reduce or override differences in perspectives and behaviour which stem from other social, cultural and demographic influences” (Signorielli and Morgan, 2009, p. 1113).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** imagery observed influence attitudes and belief systems by perpetuating racial stereotypes and objectification of women as a result of over sexualisation of female characters. Scharrer (2013) argues that the media plays a pivotal role in providing social cues and messages of social norms and values in how it informs the audience on dominant ways of performing and experiencing gender and race through the narratives and characterisation of individuals on screen
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** just as media could shape ideas about individuals ideologies, personal ideologies can also shape how individuals derive meaning from media. From this, there is a possibility that there is an element of ‘selective exposure’ whereby individuals are consciously or unconsciously choosing media (video games) that reflect their own pre-existing ideologies and points of view (Zillmann and Bryant, 1985).
                
            
        

    
**Page 11**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Despite these pre-determined limitations, video games are designed to offer the player a “fair chance of redeeming [them]selves” which “distinguishes game failure from failure of [their] regular lives” (Juul, 2013, p. 7). This is indicative of the neo-liberal idea of meritocracy, the idea that you are responsible for your own achievements and if you try hard enough you
                
            
        

    
**Page 12**

        
            
- **Highlight:** will be able to succeed and triumph (Muriel and Crawford, 2020)
                
            
        

    
**Page 17**

        
            
- **Highlight:** This also reflects Gramsci’s hegemonic masculine lens whereby masculinity often hinges on men remaining in positions of power (Connell, 1995; 2001; 2001; 2005 and Levy 2007)
                
            
        

    
**Page 19**

        
            
- **Highlight:** tokenistic, which is a “powerful conceptual lens” (Drenten, Harrinson and Pendarvis, 2022, p. 2) as it often disguises exclusion as inclusion through the mere presence of minority groups (Holgersson and Romani, 2020)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** friction between inclusion and exclusion comes from the perceived granting of permission for the minority group to be present in the dominant groups domain as opposed to belonging there equally to each other (Laws, 1975).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Tokenism can lead to three behavioural outcomes: role entrapment, performance pressures and boundary heightening.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Kanter (1977) defines role entrapment as a set of characteristics in which particular groups are expected to abide by due to the way they are depicted in media.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Performance pressure as described by Santos, Amâncio and Roux (2015) is the pressure minoritised groups feel to continually prove their worth or emphasize their achievements in order to feel accepted in dominant group spaces.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** boundary heightening is the concept that particular communities will emphasise the norms of the dominant groups so as to isolate any who do not naturally or seemingly hold these norms also (Kanter, 1977).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** A result of boundary heightening is that women will often allow themselves to become the target of derogatory humour and downplay their own exclusion and gender discrimination that they receive in order to feel a greater sense of belonging (Holgerson and Romani, 2020)

**Page 7**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Comstock and Cobbey (1997) argue that there is an effect on identify and self-esteem and that representation serves as a marker for individuals to know they carry weight in society (Royse et al., 2007).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Therefore, a marked absence of representation could lead to a feeling of irrelevance, unimportance in society and a lack of power (Mastro and Behm-Marowitz, 2005).
                
            
        

    
**Page 8**

        
            
- **Highlight:** games representations may serve to reinforce and validate pre- existing ideas that individuals already hold.
                
            
        

    
**Page 10**

        
            
- **Highlight:** immersion and blending of self (player) and character is theorised to be a trigger for what Prentice-Dunn et al. (1982) describes as a loss of self-awareness, which Prentice-Dunn et al. considers to be crucial in the deindividuation process.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Deindividuation is a psycho-social theory that describes reduced inner restraint when it comes to engaging in undesirable and uncharacteristic behaviour (Festinger, Pepitone, and Newcomb, 1952).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** key criteria that should be met for this process to be present is a sense of anonymity that leads to a loss of internal restraints due to diminished responsibility (Zimbardo, 1969)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** present in online spaces like online games or forums
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Prentice-Dunn et al. (1982) argued, a reduction in self-awareness is also a crucial element for deindividuation to be triggered.
                
            
        

    
**Page 11**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Shaw (2014), compared this idea to the issue of representation within video games, stating that the increase of autonomy and freedom of choice within games extends to character creation mechanics.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Video games are placing the burden of representation onto players “rather than include diversity in the games with set characters, most representation of marginalised groups and identifiers is placed in the hands of the players” (Shaw, 2014, p.35).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Sims as a game designed to offer extensive character and life creation options was also recently criticised for lack of skin colour diversity as well as well as lack of ethnic hair options (Ade-Yusuf, 2020; Jackson, 2020)
                
            
        

    
**Page 14**

        
            
- **Highlight:** ways in which they “reflect, reinforce, question and subvert cultural ideas about the categories of masculine and feminine” (Salen and Zimmerman, 2004 p. 522)
                
            
        

    
**Page 16**

        
            
- **Highlight:** More than any other group, video game is most strongly associated with masculinity (Kaye, Pennington and McCann, 2018; Fishbune, 2018)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Irene Van Driel, and Fritz (2016) highlighted that even though the overt sexualisation of female characters has declined since the mid-1990’s, female characters are still contained into trope boxes, subjected to being secondary roles primarily there to support the male protagonist or merely as plot devices.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** female characters become tokenistic, despite women continuing to represent a vastly growing demographic in the gaming industry both at consumer and developer level (ESA, 2022)
                
            
        

    
**Page 17**

        
            
- **Highlight:** This can be seen throughout video game history whereby male characters are designed to be ultra-masculine in their physical prowess and power and rarely deviate from the narrow range of depictions of masculinity (Condis, 2018).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Scharrer (2004); Miller and Summers (2007); Burgess et al (2011) also identify toughness, stoicism and aggression specifically as key defining traits in male video game characters, which reflects the seven key components of traditional masculinity identified by Levant, Hall and Rankin (2013)
                
            
        

    
**Page 18**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Black (2018)’s article also highlights that there is a distinct lack of exploration of expressions of masculinity in a research area that focuses quite heavily on influences on violence.
                
            
        

    
**Page 19**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Downs and Smith (2010); Lynch, et al (2016) highlighted that women were far more likely to be portrayed sexually with 41% of the 60 games they analysed depicting women in revealing, sexualised clothing compared to just 11% of their male counterparts
                
            
        

    
**Page 20**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Lara became most notably known as an object of desire as opposed to an intelligent, independent and capable role model for women

- **Highlight:** Bradford (2010) argues that video game players identities are shaped by many other variables such as the cultures in which they reside, their lived
                
            
        

    
**Page 9**

        
            
- **Highlight:** experiences and factors like their individual dispositions, abilities and interests.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** gamers are assumed to possess minimal ability for independent thought and as such are considered passive participants and extremely impressionable, but players “do not leave their critical capacities behind” (Bradford, 2010, p.54)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Bradford (2010) explains that as no two players are the same, neither is the meaning nor are the messages derived from the game, as no two experiences are exactly the same.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Kryzwinska (2006, p. 383) also argues this by describing games as like “thick texts richly populated with various allusions, correspondences, references and connotations” but that players experience of this ‘thickness’ is completely dependent on what prior world knowledge and experiences they bring to the game.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** This exchange requires explicit participation by players (Kirby, 2009) and although video games were originally designed as simple puzzle games, as modern technology has improved and games have become both more realistic graphically and more complex narratively, they become an increasingly higher-level participatory experience.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** do not merely consume a pre-established piece of media, but instead are active participants in the creation of their experience” (Calleja, 2011, p.56)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** forces players to engage
                
            
        

    
**Page 10**

        
            
- **Highlight:** with the characters on a deeper level, which can lead to players believing that what is happening to the characters is happening to themselves or lead to them feeling like they know the characters on an intimate level.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Players can’t manipulate games completely and unincumbered, they are still bound by the restrictions imposed by the games mechanics and pre-written narrative (Crawford, 2012), but there is an increasingly developing nature of agency, whereby more games are offering more choices that effect the outcomes of the game or development of the character.

**Page 11**

        
            
- **Highlight:** More games are leaving the identity of the protagonist up to the player, and as such a lack of representation within games is down to player choice rather than developer choice.
                
            
        

    
**Page 16**

        
            
- **Highlight:** gaming was not born sexist” and was initially designed as simple puzzle games for everyone (Kirkpatrick, 2017, p.453).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** However, as time went on the design of games began to reflect traditionally masculine hobbies such as hunting and car racing, and later war and battle style games.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** So somewhere along the line, the messaging that video games are exclusively for boys diluted the interest for girls to enter the video game development space as a by-product of feeling excluded and not because of a lack of interest.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Games are primarily designed through what is known as the ‘male gaze’ (Oxford Reference, Feminist Frequency, 2018)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** ESA data shows that women make up about 40-50%, yet in 2016 a mere 3% of video games published included female protagonists with Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) being the only AAA game with a female lead protagonist in 2016’s E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) convention, which only rose to 18% in 2020, and generally only showing around 7-9% of games focusing on women (Feminist Frequency, 2018)
                
    -  *Note:* need to update these statistics
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Misogyny continues to remain deeply embedded in gaming community and development processes (Jenson and de Castell, 2018)
                
            
        

    
**Page 18**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Violence is so embedded in gaming culture it permeates all aspects of gaming, including casual language use in online gaming such as the use of the word rape to simply mean overpowered. As a consequence of the casual-ness of the use of such words, issues of sexual assault becomes minimised (Leonard, 2020). Additionally, De Angeli and Brahnam (2006) observed that the use of sexually violent language was increased when players thought they were interacting with a female player through the use of a female avatar, versus when they interacted with who they thought was a male player through a male avatar.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** women in gaming spaces, particularly in violent online games like Call of Duty are predicted to be poorer at playing, and for female gamers to be respected as equal players they have to play twice as well or be branded a poser as female gamers being considered too feminine or kind to play FPS (First Person Shooter) games like Call of Duty (McDaniel, 2016).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** expectation for female players to adhere to these rules to be considered accepted in the male dominated world of FPS games
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** in games where there are multiple roles, female players are often expected to play more feminine supporting roles. Angela Gerric (2020)

- **Highlight:** Ink_defined stated that she has received comments like “You’re a girl. You play as a healer”. Female players are often boxed in and expected to stick to particular roles so as to be the least involved in direct combat.
                
            
        

    
**Page 20**

        
            
- **Highlight:** gaming market is primarily male so female characters must appeal to men sexually or they would not be interested in buying the game (Jans and Martis, 2007)

**Page 13**

        
            
- **Highlight:** studies have gathered a group of participants and analysed the games they play, and the participants own account of their attitudes and behaviour. The issue here is that this kind of research can’t take into account the complexity of multiple influences on human behaviour such as family values and beliefs, peer pressure, other media messages, capacity to discern right from wrong regardless of media message and very rarely does the research look at participants belief, attitudes and behaviour prior to consuming video games
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Palmquist’s relational content analysis method was adopted, also known by many other names such as, but not limited to; textual analysis, meaning analysis, or mental model analysis which was adapted in the 1990’s from the more traditional ‘content analysis’ (Mills, Durepos and Wiebe, 2010).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** traditional content analysis would only allow for identifying patterns or themes with little room for exploring these themes on a deeper level by looking at the relationship between what was observed and what the potential outcome is on culture and social discourse.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** advantage to adopting this particular method in this dissertation is that it provides a good base for solid theoretical analysis, whereby it can be guided by a good understanding of linguistics, cognitive science and mental models
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** what comes with this kind of research is a lot of time consumed and potential for multiple interpretations.
