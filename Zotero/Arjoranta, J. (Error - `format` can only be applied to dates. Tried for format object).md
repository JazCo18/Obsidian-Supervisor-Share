## Summary (from abstract - if present)
This paper presents a hermeneutic theory for game studies. It starts by giving an overview of hermeneutics, shows how in understanding games it is useful to divide hermeneutics into two aspects -- real-time hermeneutics and game hermeneutics -- and finishes by detailing complementary approaches to hermeneutics for games. The article builds upon earlier work in the hermeneutics of games and draws from philosophical hermeneutics.

- **Highlight:** hermeneutics, a theory of interpretation going back thousands of years. Hermeneutics have previously benefited other areas requiring interpretation, like law, history and literature, so using it to understand games should also be possible.

- **Highlight:** According to this view, interpretation is necessary not just to understand humanity, but to be human.
                
    -  *Note:* about hermeneutics applied to philosophy
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Heidegger, understanding is what happens when we are thrown into the world and must cope with it. This thrownness is Heidegger’s way of expressing that the world already exists before we get there, and already matters to us in multiple ways before we try to understand it
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Heidegger: we are thrown into a world that precedes us and try to make sense of it in relation to our position in the world and with specific goals in mind.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Gadamer thinks our options are rather limited by the surroundin

- **Highlight:** circumstances. We are born into specific historical conditions, which determine what kinds of positions we have access to
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** historical circumstances provide us what Gadamer (2004, p. 273) calls “prejudices,” but what can also be understood more neutrally through Heidegger’s term of “fore-conception” (Gadamer, 2004, p. 269).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** crucial idea is that there is no neutral starting position
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** “we are always already affected by history” (Gadamer, 2004, p. 300)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** historical circumstances that predetermine the “horizon” (Gadamer, 2004, p. 301) of interpretations available to us
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** The goal of philosophical hermeneutics is not to understand what the author meant with a text, but what it means when applied in a particular horizon.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** what we consider subjective or arbitrary and good or bad interpretations needs to be evaluated against the background of the cultural and historical context they are made in.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** temporal distance” -- the passage of time -- helps in seeing things in a broader context, and thus, better (Gadamer, 2004, pp. 297-98)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** the task of understanding is never over, since there are always new historical situations that affect how previous history should be understood

- **Highlight:** hermeneutics (e.g., Möring, 2013; cf. Karhulahti, 2015) 3. independently of human meaning-making, but a culture where they are played makes them games. Other Approaches to Philosophical Hermeneutics This article focuses on the philosophical hermeneutics of Heidegger and Gadamer, because their particular approach to hermeneutics is most useful for understanding games. However, they are a fraction of thinkers relevant to philosophical hermeneutics. For example, Paul Ricoeur is one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, who also contributed to philosophical hermeneutics (Dauenhauer and Pellauer, 2014; Grondin, 2014). One notion especially relevant to understanding play is Ricoeur’s (1981) idea of interpreting meaningful action as text. He shows how tools from hermeneutics can be used for understanding human activity, which is also useful for explaining play activity. Other philosophers have also contributed to the development of philosophical hermeneutics indirectly or as opponents. For example, Jürgen Habermas had influential discussions with Gadamer that affected how both thought of hermeneutics, language and interpretation (Mendelson, 1979). Habermas presented a Marxist critique of how Gadamer’s hermeneutics had problems dealing with issues outside language, like power and labor. Another influential philosopher was Jacques Derrida, who had much in common with Gadamer: both philosophers were interested in questions of interpretation, language and texts. However, in practice they disagreed on much, with Derrida accusing Gadamer of veering into metaphysics with his hermeneutics (Botz-Bornstein, 2013; Evink, 2021). These approaches inform the rest of this article, but receive little analysis because they are less relevant to understanding game hermeneutics. Philosophical Hermeneutics for Games Hermeneutic Terminology The terminology used to discuss hermeneutics in game studies is confusing. In addition to simply writing about “hermeneutics” (Kłosiński, 2021) or “hermeneutic inquiry” (Tanenbaum, 2015), there are at least four concepts used, with slightly different meanings: 1. Game hermeneutics (e.g., Möring, 2013; cf. Vella, 2015) . Textual hermeneutics (e.g., Möring, 2013; cf. Karhulahti, 2015) 3. independently of human meaning-making, but a culture where they are played makes them games.

**Page 3**

        
            
- **Highlight:** There are methodologies for conducting hermeneutic interpretations of games, for example by using close reading (e.g., Bizzocchi and Tanenbaum, 2011; Tanenbaum, 2015

- **Highlight:** Marxist hermeneutics (e.g., Bloch, Benjamin, Jameson), analytic hermeneutics (e.g., von Wright, Winch), objective hermeneutics (Popper)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** hermeneutic circle. This concept typically refers to two processes: 1. Interpreting a text requires moving between understanding specific sections in light of the whole and vice preting a text requires moving between understanding specific sections in light of the whole and vice versa; 2. The process of interpretation starts from our preconceptions of what is true on a topic and moves forward by comparing process of interpretation starts from our preconceptions of what is true on a topic and moves forward by comparing them to what a text says on the topic. The textual message pic and moves forward by comparing them to what a text says on the topic. The textual message shapes our preconceptions, which we then use again to ys on the topic. The textual message shapes our preconceptions, which we then use again to understand what the text preconceptions, which we then use again to understand what the text says
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** processes are seen as circular, moving between the general/preconceived and specific/actual
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** each round on the circle improves our understanding of the topic (Gadamer, 2004, p. 269)
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Wilhelm Dilthey went further and sought to make hermeneutics into a general method for humanities (Schmidt, 2006).
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** humanities were being systematized, often by following the example of natural sciences
                
            
        

    
**Page 4**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Being and Time (Heidegger, 1996) was to rethink the basis for Western metaphysics, only part of his work is relevant to our interest in interpreting games

- **Highlight:** While the interpretation of a literary or filmatic [cinematic] work will require certain analytical pretation of a literary or filmatic [cinematic] work will require certain analytical skills, the game requires analysis practiced as performance, [cinematic] work will require certain analytical skills, the game requires analysis practiced as performance, with direct feedback from the system. This is a game requires analysis practiced as performance, with direct feedback from the system. This is a dynamic, real-time hermeneutics that lacks a ystem. This is a dynamic, real-time hermeneutics that lacks a corresponding structure in film or structure in film or literature. Reading a book or viewing a film does not provide direct feedback, in the sense that our performance g a book or viewing a film does not provide direct feedback, in the sense that our performance is evaluated in real time.

- **Highlight:** Real-time hermeneutics inform game hermeneutics, but are not necessary to perform game hermeneutics. It is possible to understand a game in relation to the surrounding culture without playing it (e.g., by watching someone else play it) -- it is simply harder. Sometimes this is necessary: for example, it might be possible to study high-level esports by participating in the game oneself, but for many game scholars it is simply impossible to acquire the skills needed to compete on that level (see also Hock-koon, 2012). A personal phenomenological experience of a game is nevertheless informative (Aarseth, 2003; Karppi and Sotamaa, 2012).

- **Highlight:** Usually, we have an uncomplicated relationship with the world, which we approach with specific goals. For example, when needing to hammer a nail, the hammer does not raise questions of its mode of existence, and instead appears to us ready-to-hand, phenomenologically transparent (Wheeler, 2020) [4]. We only have to consider the hammer if for some reason it fails to fulfil the task we are performing, for example, by falling apart while we are hammering away. When this happens, the object becomes un-ready-to-hand, no longer phenomenologically transparent and in need of closer examination
                
    -  *Note:* undecided on its relevance yet as this is a weird analogy - on Heidegger understanding of hermeneutics

- **Highlight:** Games exists in a manner similar to works of art. They exist independently of humans, like statues or readymade sculptures, but require people to engage with them as games to be games.

- **Highlight:** independently of human meaning-making, but a culture where they are played makes them games.
                
    -  *Note:* claiming board games, critical roms and digital downloads exist independently.... I don't think that's true. does that not disregard the meaning making from the creator perspective? when artists write songs, they often have a specific meaning behind them, this can be reinterpreted sure, but it has meaning from conception because a human made it.
                
            
        

    
**Page 8**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Before the mid-2000s, there were multiple attempts at making sense of meaning in games using literary studies and narratology (e.g., Buse, 1996; Eskelinen, 2001; Kücklich, 2002; Ziegfeld, 1989)
                
            
        

    
**Page 9**

        
            
- **Highlight:** Sicart’s (2009) theory of ethics of computer games. He draws on Gadamerian hermeneutics when explaining the player’s position as a moral subject, discussing the hermeneutic process as a process of self-understanding.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** The central idea of real-time hermeneutics is that games provide feedback on whether the player’s interpretation is correct or not (cf. Buse, 1996) [12]. Arjoranta (2011) gives an example of real-time hermeneutics using Super Mario Bros. (Nintendo R&D4, 1985): The interpretations a player makes during the game influence his or her actions, and subsequently, pretations a player makes during the game influence his or her actions, and subsequently, success in the game. For example, if one interprets the , and subsequently, success in the game. For example, if one interprets the Koopa Troopa-turtles in Super Mario Bros. (Nintendo game. For example, if one interprets the Koopa Troopa-turtles in Super Mario Bros. (Nintendo Creative Department 1985) as friendly and tries to hug them, pa-turtles in Super Mario Bros. (Nintendo Creative Department 1985) as friendly and tries to hug them, it will probably result in the plumber-protagonist partment 1985) as friendly and tries to hug them, it will probably result in the plumber-protagonist Mario losing his life. In this case, we can say that it is probably result in the plumber-protagonist Mario losing his life. In this case, we can say that it is the wrong interpretation to make. This does not mean g his life. In this case, we can say that it is the wrong interpretation to make. This does not mean that there is only one possible correct interpretation of g interpretation to make. This does not mean that there is only one possible correct interpretation of the game itself, but that the game supports some y one possible correct interpretation of the game itself, but that the game supports some and opposes some interpretations. (Arjoranta, 2011, game itself, but that the game supports some and opposes some interpretations. (Arjoranta, 2011, p. 6
                
    -  *Note:* this is useful for discussing power in games to reinforce reflect or oppose edi issues.

- **Highlight:** this type of hermeneutic is not evaluated by the game. Developers or players may care what the cultural status of games is, but that is not evaluated by the game during play
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** Game hermeneutics are informed by the prejudices of the interpreter.
                
            
        
            
- **Highlight:** All interpretation happens in relation to these preconceptions (cf. Vella, Gualeni, and Arjoranta, 2019
