Taylor’s findings demonstrate that interpretation stems less from the game’s official narrative (or "backstory") and more from the **social and systemic practices** players develop:

Meaning is found in shared struggles—such as the "grind" or narrowly escaping a "train" of monsters—which are valued as powerful communal experiences, regardless of the explicit game storyline.

**Boundary Objects and Fluctuating Meaning:** Taylor describes the game itself as a continuously changing **boundary object**. Its definition and meaning are plastic enough to satisfy different communities (designers, hardcore players, casual players) yet robust enough to maintain a common identity. This illustrates that interpretation is dynamic and contested, depending on the player’s particular community of practice
