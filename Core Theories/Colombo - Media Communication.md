**The Rise of Minimal Effects:** Subsequent experimental empirical research, particularly the Yale School studies (Hovland, Janis & Kelley, 1953), moved away from the idea that media exerted direct and unlimited influence. These studies introduced intervening variables (e.g., selective perception, cognitive structures, social-demographical characteristics) to explain how the effectiveness of messages varied

**The Two-Step Flow:** The idea that **interpersonal relationships** play a key role in influence led to the two-step flow of communication (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955), where opinion leaders mediate and interpret content for others

**The Unchanged Paradigm:** Although these revisions added complexity (recognizing selective attention and social context), they did **not lead to a paradigm shift**. Communication was still fundamentally regarded as a transmission process, and language was still considered a "fundamentally problem-free and acontestual vehicle for the transmission of information"

The critical shift from linear to dialogical and discursive models is deemed "of utmost importance both at a theoretical and methodological level". This shift was driven by the "linguistic turn"—the widespread awareness of the role of language as the **constituent mechanism of 'reality'**

**Language as Social Practice:** In this new perspective, language is no longer seen as a neutral tool for describing a separate external reality, but as a **social practice**

**Media and Reality Construction:** The media are thus seen to have a "fundamental role in the processes of constructing/reconstructing reality," moving beyond the idea of mere information transfer to symbolic construction, shaping perceptions and knowledge distribution

**The Dialogical Model: Negotiation and Contract**

**Circular Co-production:** Communication is redefined as a **circular communication** or an "interlocutory relationship" tied to the **co-production and negotiation of meanings**. This is deemed a "strong interactionism" that moves beyond simple retroaction

<span style="background:#d3f8b6">**Co-construction of Worlds:** The concept of "transmitter/receiver" is replaced by "interlocutor/co-locutor," who engage in the **co-construction of possible worlds**. The aim of communication is the sharing of a world order.</span>

**Verisimilarity in Media:** Since media communication lacks the physical presence of interlocutors, it relies on discursive devices to simulate the contractual validation. What the media shows is not necessarily reality or truth, but **verisimilar** (it appears to be true). The ultimate function of a medium is not just to inform, but to "construct significance and meanings"

CDA (Fairclough, Van Dijk) focuses on how discourse is fundamentally shaped by **relations of power and ideologies**.

• **Ideology and Institutional Context:** Within the CDA framework, media are seen as an institutional context that appropriates, organizes, and constructs representations of the world according to its own logic and purposes. Discourse is the primary instrument for the production and reproduction of shared social knowledge.

• **Critique of 'Audience':** CDA finds the concept of the "audience" unsatisfactory because it creates a "false identification with the average reader (or television viewer), a pure abstraction and artifact constructed by the media itself".

• **Van Dijk’s Multilevel Analysis:** Van Dijk’s work emphasizes analyzing media discourse (like news) not only linguistically but also in relation to the **social practices and ideologies of newsmaking** and the **institutional macro-sociological contexts**.

    ◦ This analysis differentiates between **microstructural descriptions** (grammar, pragmatics) and **macrostructural descriptions** (global coherence, thematic structures).

    ◦ Van Dijk demonstrated how rhetoric and strategic devices (like selective use of sources, specific modifications in relevance, and use of numbers) are employed to enhance the perception of truthfulness and credibility, often depicting ethnic minorities as problematic groups in the process.

B. Discursive Psychology (DP)

DP (Mac Millan & Edwards) offers a contrast by focusing intensively on the **rhetoric** of discourse rather than systematic ideological structuring.

• **Focus on 'How':** DP advocates for avoiding systemic coding categories and focusing on the details of texts "as found". Analysis focuses on **how factual descriptions are assembled and made factual through a range of rhetorical devices**.

• **Internal Management:** DP typically avoids the "why" question (i.e., external factors like political economy) in favor of the "how," arguing that the _why_ issues (motive, accountability, interests) are often handled and managed _within_ the text itself as a discursive negotiation.
