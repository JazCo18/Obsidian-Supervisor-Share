### Title: 
Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse (Chapter in Culture, Media and Language)
### Authors:
Stuart Hall
### Context/Summary: 
**Hall breaks down how media messages, especially from television, are created and understood, amphasizing that it is a highly structured process where meaning is constantly shaped by power and context**
- Rejects old simple linear models (sender/message/receiver) in favour of more complex structure
- Communication must be understood as a loop connecting four linked but unique stages: Production, Circulation, Distribution/Consumption, and Reproduction
### Method:
- Uses structural and economic analogy - Halls approach is similar to the framework used by Marx in his Grundrisse and Capital to analyse commodity production
- He uses semiotic paradigm (the study of signs and symbols that helps to analyse how signs function within a system) to understand how signs are encoded and then decoded
- Uses denotation and connotation as useful analytic tools, emphasising the signs usually combine both
### Research Question:
These are implied questions as this is not a research paper
- How can the continuous circuit be sustained through a "passage of forms"
- How do encoding and decoding codes diverge, and what social structures cause the resulting asymmetry?
### Key Claims:
Communication is a structures loop
- Communication is a complex circuit that runs in a cycle. The circuit is: production (making the message), circulation (spreading it), consumption (receiving/decoding it), and reproduction (its effect on society)
- Each stage is unique, but are still connected - no stage can fully guarantee the next
- Messages must be stories or meaningful discourse before it can be communicated
- If the message meaning is not translated into social practice, it has no effect
Messages are always coded and shaped by power
- No message is intelligible without the operation of a system of rules (code). 
- Signs gain their ideological power at the level of connotation (the meaning people make of it), where they connect to a cultures "maps of meaning" and enter the "struggle over meanings"
- Power imprints preferred reading, in that they encode messages to produce "preferred readings" that support the existing institutional, political, and ideological structure
Decoding is not guaranteed by encoding
- The code used by the producer/creator are not always in line with the decoding results of the audience
- When the codes don't match, it leads to "systematically distorted communication" (misunderstandings)
- The viewer generally takes one of three positions when decoding, which demonstrates that meaning is not fixed
	- Dominant: accepts the message in full and as intended
	- Negotiated: Accepts the main idea but makes exceptions based on their own local situation
	- Oppositional: Understands the intended message but rejects it, and re-interprets it using a completely opposite view
The typology outlines three hypothetical audience positions from which decodings are constructed. Hall assumed, especially for news, that texts were encoded within the dominant ideology.

1. Dominant-Hegemonic Position

• **Alignment:** The viewer takes the connoted meaning "full and straight" and **decodes the message using the same code in which it was encoded**.

• **Communication Ideal:** This is the ideal-typical case of "perfectly transparent communication".

• **The Professional Code:** A variety of the dominant code used by broadcasters, which applies technico-practical criteria but operates within the hegemony of the dominant code, thus reproducing dominant definitions.

2. Negotiated Code/Position

• **Mixed Response:** Decoding contains a mixture of **adaptive and oppositional elements**.

• **Acceptance and Exception:** The decoder acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions at a **grand, abstract level** (e.g., national interest), but operates with exceptions and makes their own ground rules at a more restricted, **situational, or specific level**.

• **Mismatches:** The great majority of "misunderstandings" are suspected to arise from the contradictions between dominant encodings and negotiated decodings.

3. Oppositional Code/Position

• **Global Rejection:** The viewer perfectly understands both the literal and connotative inflection of the discourse but decodes the message in a **globally contrary way**.

• **Alternative Framework:** The decoder detotalizes the message in the preferred code to retotalize it within some alternative frame of reference (e.g., interpreting "national interest" as "class interest").

• **Semiotic Disobedience:** This reading is sometimes related to **semiotic disobedience**, where audience members impose a personally meaningful reading and resist ideological influence.
**Denotation and Connotation**: Hall utilized these terms as analytic tools, not real-world distinctions.
    ◦ **Denotation** refers to the literal or near-universally recognized meaning of a sign, often confused with "natural" meaning. Its ideological value is strongly fixed because it has become so fully universal and "naturalized".
    ◦ **Connotation** refers to more changeable, associative meanings, which are open to articulation with wider ideological discourses. It is at this level that situational ideologies actively intervene in discourse.
    ◦ Media texts are polysemic, meaning they have a multiplicity of meanings, but a dominant cultural order tends to enforce preferred meanings
### Use in my Thesis:
- Lays the foundation for the approach my thesis is going to take when analysing participant data and the meaning derived from games.
- It is a distinct theoretical approach and differs from both media effects theory, and more sociological theories that talk exclusively of media causing an impact, and providing those messages - excluding the nuances of individuality and how humans derive meaning in differential ways to each other
### Critique/Limitations:
- Conflation of the encoded meaning and ideological tendency
	- There is an assumption that the encoded meaning is within the dominant ideology. Meaning ideological tendency of the message is taken for granted
	- This means some people theorise that Dominant, Negotiated and Oppositional positions are actually primarily ideological positions (reflecting the consumers stance towards the dominant ideology), or text-relative position where the consumers stance is relative only to the encoded meaning of that specific text (i.e agreeing or disagreeing with the message regardless of ideology)
	- If the consumer engages with media that isn't encoded with the dominant framework, then the theory/typology breaks down. E.g a consumer who is oppositional to the dominant ideology would also simultaneously be dominant (or text-accepting) in relation to the text itself
	- **Conflation of Dimensions:** The typology conflates two dimensions: **ideological position** (opposed to dominant ideology) and **text-relative position** (opposed to the encoded meaning, whatever it is)
	- **Lack of Comprehension:** Critics noted the need to disentangle **comprehension** (literal understanding) and **evaluation** (agreement/disagreement). The model provides no formal place for comprehension separate from the three decoding positions
Proposed Modifications: Alternative Typologies

One attempt to overcome the problems, especially the restrictive focus on dominant-hegemonic encoding, is to modify the typology by expanding it to the encoding level.

• **The Modification Strategy:** By distinguishing the model proper from the typology, and by applying the dominant, negotiated, and oppositional framework to _encoding_ as well as decoding, a more complex typology of **nine distinct combinations** is created.

Version 1: The Ideology Version (Figure 2)

This version interprets the decoding positions as **ideological standpoints**.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Encoding Position →|Dominant-Hegemonic (Hall's assumed mode)|Negotiated (Partly critical text)|Oppositional (Radical text)|
|**Dominant-Hegemonic Decoding**|D-H reading of D-H text|**Neutralization**|**Neutralization**|
|**Negotiated Decoding**|Negotiated reading of D-H text|Negotiated reading of negotiated text|Negotiated reading of oppositional text|
|**Oppositional Decoding**|Oppositional reading of D-H text|**Amplification of Critique**|**Agreement with Oppositional Text**|

• **Neutralization:** This critical new concept covers situations where media texts encoded within a negotiated or oppositional framework are **decoded within the frame of a dominant ideology**.

    ◦ _Example:_ A conservative viewer interpreting a program conveying gross inequalities not as a social report, but as evidence of "leftist bias" among journalists.

Version 2: The Text-Relative Version (Figure 3)

This version interprets the decoding positions based on **agreement or opposition with the encoded meaning**, irrespective of ideological tendency.

• **Terminology Change:** 'Dominant-hegemonic' becomes **'Text-accepting'** and 'oppositional' becomes **'Text-oppositional'**.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Encoding Position →|Dominant-Hegemonic|Negotiated|Oppositional|
|**Text-Accepting Decoding**|Text-acceptance of D-H text|Text-acceptance of negotiated text|Text-acceptance of oppositional text|
|**Text-Negotiation Decoding**|Negotiation of D-H text|Negotiation of negotiated text|Negotiation of oppositional text|
|**Text-Oppositional Decoding**|T-O reading of D-H text|T-O reading of negotiated text|**Neutralization**|

• **Text-Oppositional Decodings:** This category can be expanded beyond ideological disagreement to include other neutralizing elements like **'distraction,' 'non-comprehension,' 'indifference,'** and **'program construction awareness'**.

• **Empirical Examples of Neutralization:**

    ◦ Interpreting a scene about businessmen scheming against farmers as merely "entertainment," or ignoring class differences in a quarrel by focusing on the couple's personalities.

    ◦ Dismissing class conflict in a serial like _Falcon Crest_ by focusing on the genre conventions or lack of realism ("It’s only a serial...").

    ◦ In TV news, raising suspicion against journalists (e.g., questioning a CEO about salary during an item on unemployment risk) to downplay criticism against authorities or companies.

Alternative Dimensional Models

• **Schrøder’s Multidimensional Model (2000):** This is a reception-only, dimensional model that acts as an alternative to Hall’s typology by differentiating several types of decoding, including attentiveness, comprehension, and interpretation. It includes six dimensions for reception analysis:

    ◦ **Motivation:** Interests, motives, and relevance of the text for the receiver.

    ◦ **Comprehension:** Extent of basic understanding, relative to the sender’s intention or other interpretations.

    ◦ **Discrimination:** Awareness of the media text's ‘constructedness.’

    ◦ **Position:** The subjective attitude toward the perceived textual position.

    ◦ **Evaluation:** The analyst relates readings to ideological positions (later dropped as a researcher category).

    ◦ **Implementation:** Whether readings influence action or the use of media as a political resource.

• **Michelle’s Composite Multidimensional Model (2007):** This framework distinguishes between the **positional level** (response relative to the preferred meaning, similar to the text-relative dimension) and **evaluation** (the objective ideological level).

## **Alternative Research Paradigms**

• **Spectacle/Performance Paradigm (SPP):** Proposed by Abercrombie and Longhurst (1998) to succeed the Incorporation/Resistance Paradigm (IRP) defined by Hall’s model. The SPP shifts focus to processes of **performance** both in the media and among audiences, who are seen as interactive and performing media input in their daily life.

• **Resistance/Performance Paradigm (RPP):** Atkinson and Dougherty (2006) modified the SPP to account for questions of **power and ideology** in a more sufficient way, dealing with oppositional groups and oppositional texts.

• **Media as Practices:** Couldry (2004) proposed shifting research focus from media texts and production structures to the **open-ended range of practices focused directly or indirectly on media**. This approach asks what people are doing in relation to media across various situations and contexts.

While these approaches shift the research questions to other areas, none have yet generated an influence resembling that of Hall's original Encoding/Decoding model
### Notes:
- This is a starter for ten theory - Hall himself that this theory did not have the theoretical rigor, the internal logic and conceptual consistency to last for decades.
- He intended the model to suggest an approach and map the terrain, but believed it needed to be worked with and developed and changed.
### Useful Quotes:
"to put it paradoxically, the event must become a story before it can become a communicative event"
"before this message can have an effect, it must first be appropriated as a meaningful discourse and meaningfully decoded"
