**Gaming at the edge of sexuality**
- Shaw starts their preface by talking about how research uncovered a lack of prioritisation in the mind of players when it came to marginalised representation (about people like them), as most were more concerned with actual issues (of homophobia, sexism and racism) in online or real life gaming spaces.
- Shaw also noted that people just did not take it seriously like the did other media representations. Responses about how video games are a niche medium (as of 2015 when this book was written), fantasy environments, designed for a narrow market.
- Shaw draws on the outburst following the Hunger Games film adaption's choice of actress to play Rue (described as having dark brown skin and eyes in the book) to not have met their own personal perception of the character (perceived by many as being white and blonde haired, despite descriptions stating otherwise). Shaw points out that this shows that representation does matter to audiences, and that people clearly connect with media texts via a "intertwined process of identity and identification" - namely, the critiques where not about the actress choice, but about how they pictured someone different in their mind, connected to that mental image and the character associated with that image, and then felt like that connection was lost when the representation on screen did not match their own internal picture.
- We can get pleasure from text that represent us, and also those that don't. But Media texts provides us with material for what might be possible, what identities might be constructed, and what worlds we might live in. It shows us what forms of existence could be possible.
- Shaw raises a warning with the solution often prescribed to lack of representation being a "add women and stir" approach (named by Charlotte Bunch), which ignored system and structural issues in the gaming industry that will not be resolved by simply adding more women to the profession, and also overlooks and dismisses men's ability to write create texts that are not representational of themselves or their fantasies - it becomes a "woman's responsibility" to fix it (weaponised incompetence?).
- Placing responsibility on women to fix the failure of female representation also ignores the fact that there are plenty of white, straight men who do actually also care about representation in video games - be it for their own moral grounding, or because they see video games production as being richer and better for it.
