- "new pop cosmopolitanism is being promoted by corporate interests  both in Asia and in the West.""5 Scholars have begun to map this trend, pointing to  how anime fans see the material as more complex and thought-provoking than most Western media, as well as how "all things Japan" come to be seen as "cool" in the  West.16 That trend has historical roots which span at least 150 years, with similar fads  or interest in "all thingsJapanese" influencing the Impressionists in Europe, and other intellectuals and middle class citizens as time passed, as Susan Napier has noted.'"
	- So - is this effecting Western developers creation process? Capitalising on this "Japan is cool" rhetoric when producing games, rather than focusing on telling truly representational stories?
- Japan has wide success with Japanese produced games in the West, but the West rarely ever makes it into Japanese top 50 games each year, with Japanese games dominating Japanese charts.
- Yet, sales charts actually show that across various Japanese companies (Konami, Square Enix, Bandai Namco to name some) all receive three quarters of their revenue from Japanese sales. With a shrinking Japanese market (declining birth rates and growing older population, this is uncertain times for Japanese studios/developers)
- Despite comparatively small global sales, Japan has contributed significantly by ways of cultural influence on the global games industry.
- ==Mention of Square Enix collaboration with Disney on Kingdom Hearts Franchise as being substantial to the companies growing and increased revenue - this is an interesting game actually. Extremely well established Japanese franchise (Final Fantasy) mixes with one the Wests most well known companies (Disney) and we have a hybrid of cultural influences, mashes together into one, very "Japanesey" style game with growing Western aesthetics (Like Pirates of the Caribbean took us away from the anime style/western cartoon aesthetic of the worlds to realistic aesthetic)==
- Bandai Namco is moving their strategy beyond localization of Japanese products and the development of overseas content: "Instead of development that is based on  the framework of 'products for Japan' and 'products for overseas' we will emphasize cooperation between Japan and overseas bases and implement worldwide development from the planning stage."
- Echoing interests in convergence, Konami sees opportunities both for global successes like Metal Gear, as well as the creation of content tied to particular regions and interests, that is, not simply Japanese content repackaged for sale elsewhere.
