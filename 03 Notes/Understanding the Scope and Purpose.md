# **Key gaps identified:**

- **Non-Western and Comparative Production/Reception:**  Most scholarship still focuses on _Japanese games travelling West_. There is very little research on Western-made content being received in Japan or other non-Western contexts, resulting in a one-directional understanding of global game circulation.
- **Interaction of Technology and Culture (Asia):**  Research on Asian video games has not sufficiently examined how game technology collides with local cultural values. Scholars argue for deeper analysis of how social, cultural, and historical factors shape a society’s adoption, design logics, aesthetics, and use of game technologies.
- **Lack of European Perspective in Global Game Studies:**  When Asia–West comparisons do exist, they overwhelmingly focus on Japan and North America. There is a recognised need for more empirical and theoretical insight into European production cultures and European player reception, including the UK, to rebalance the field.
- **Lack of Intersectional Analysis in Game Reception:**  Existing research rarely examines how multiple identities (race, gender, sexuality, disability) shape player meaning-making. This limits understanding of how different communities interpret cultural representation, historical narratives, or political themes embedded in games.
- **Gaps in Political and Cultural Impact Analysis:**  There is limited research exploring how games shape or reinforce political narratives, cultural tensions, and culture-war debates, particularly regarding representation, authenticity, and their impact on marginalised communities.
- **Orientalism and Reverse Reception:**  Scholarship critiques Orientalist tropes in Western-made games about Asia, but very little research examines how Asian audiences interpret non-Asian portrayals of their own histories and cultures—a crucial missing perspective.
- **Domestic vs Foreign Meaning-Making:**  Studies rarely compare how local players (e.g., Japanese players experiencing representations of Japanese history) and foreign players (e.g., UK players) derive meaning from the same text, leaving a gap in cross-cultural analysis of historical representation and procedural rhetoric.
- **Lack of Comparative Work Between AAA and Marginalised Creators:**  Existing scholarship tends to study either AAA productions or games made by marginalised developers. Little work compares how players interpret:
	- big studio productions appropriating marginalised cultures, versus
	- games created _by_ marginalised communities _for_ marginalised stories. This leaves a large gap in understanding reception, authenticity, and narrative legitimacy.
- **Limited Research on Reciprocal Transnational Game Flows:**  The global movement of games is often examined in one direction. Scholars highlight the need for examining reciprocal flows—including how Japanese players receive, critique, or resist Western cultural products about Japan.
- **Insufficient Analysis of Glocalisation and Culturalisation Processes:**  While localisation is studied, there is little work analysing how AAA culturalisation decisions (e.g., Ubisoft’s internal choices shaping Japanese history) influence meaning-making across different cultures.


In the existing literature, the movement of cultural products is sometimes treated as if it occurs in a universal and placeless way, but I approach it as something shaped by territory, history and cultural specificity. I focus on the UK and Japan to address a clear gap in comparative and transnational work within game studies. Japan is a crucial comparator because it is one of the most influential centres of global game production and distribution, and its cultural norms, social values and socio historical trajectories differ significantly from those of Western contexts. This allows me to examine how global games are reshaped and interpreted within distinct local settings, as players draw on their own frameworks of knowledge to produce what Hall refers to as meaning structure

The Japanese context also provides a useful foundation for exploring concepts such as strategic hybridity and conscious hybridity, which describe how national identity in Japan develops internally while being shaped by transnational media influences. Using Hall’s model, I examine how players in the UK and Japan produce different readings of the same representations, particularly where Japanese cultural material is viewed as either culturally specific or intentionally neutralised, which is sometimes described as mukokuseki, to appeal to international audiences. By placing these two cultural contexts in dialogue, I explore how locality, socio historical background and gendered experience influence the reception and interpretation of these games.
