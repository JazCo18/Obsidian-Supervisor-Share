- It is important to consider that  just as media could shape ideas about individuals ideologies, personal ideologies can also shape how  individuals derive meaning from media. From this, there is a possibility that there is an element of ‘selective  exposure’ whereby individuals are consciously or unconsciously choosing media (video games) that reflect  their own pre-existing ideologies and points of view (Zillmann and Bryant, 1985).
- People are not blank slates in which they completely and totally absorb video  game messages with no deterrence or autonomy of thought, Bradford (2010) argues that video game  players identities are shaped by many other variables such as the cultures in which they reside, their lived experiences and factors like their individual dispositions, abilities and interests - players “do not leave their critical capacities behind”  (Bradford, 2010, p.54).
- Taking this further, Bradford (2010) explains that as no two players are the same, neither is the meaning  nor are the messages derived from the game, as no two experiences are exactly the same. 
- Kryzwinska  (2006, p. 383) also argues this by describing games as like “thick texts richly populated with various  allusions, correspondences, references and connotations” but that players experience of this ‘thickness’ is  completely dependent on what prior world knowledge and experiences they bring to the game.
- Players are  not only observing the story, they are also actively in the story. They are operational and a crucial part of  the narratives, as they “do not merely consume a pre-established piece of media, but instead are active  participants in the creation of their experience” (Calleja, 2011, p.56)
