By visiting certain stands at the Comic Market, by shopping in Akihabara or  even just by making a quick internet search, researchers can easily stumble upon a treasure  trove of information on Japanese games in the form of encyclopaedias, reviews, and other in-depth articles written by dedicated gamers and published either in magazines, web pages or  self-funded fanzines over the years. All of these resources which vastly outnumber the work  from both academics and the industry, are very valuable to the contemporary game studies  researcher as they sometimes provide the first documents that direct the latter to a specific  research project. Some of those gamers also act as curators by preserving material that would  otherwise be completely lost or unobtainable (Martin Picard and Jérémie Pelletier-Gagnon, 2015)
